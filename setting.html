      <div class="content"><p>As the old earth&#39;s death rattle echoes in polluted lungs, empirical scientists and new-world artificers cooperate to develop a new life form, a self-sustaining, algaelike supraorganism which thrives off the ejecta of civilization and emits breathable air, pristine as starlight. The organism&#39;s spores burn at an unimaginable heat, forming a clean, recycled energy source harnessable by the same vast plants which once belched coal-smoke into the faltering sky.</p>
<p>In the old world, plagues licked through nations like brush fires; reactors failed and flooded and spilled their viscera into the greying ocean; the skies darkened with soot and war and with the death-stench of famine, failing crops, toxic waste, and decay. But here the air is clean. In only six years, the organism&#39;s proliferation has erased human damage once called irreversible, leaving only fast-vanishing industrial scars.</p>
<p>But with each generation of our biological savior come changes, adaptations, mutations. The spores the life-form releases fill the air invisibly, becoming as much a part of us as we of it. We wander the earth in a half-unwaking state, our collective dreams forming as much of a part of the horizon as the dirt and decay of our once-sprawling civilizations do. We build glittering, dreamlike cities that stretch far above the cloudline, the altitude clearing our heads and giving rise to powerful, aristocratic city-states, or we wander into the halls of now-alien boreal glades and forget our bodies ankle-deep in moss.</p>
<p>As the decades spin on, the airy isolation above and the reeling etherscapes below drift further and further apart. For those above, the surface is only a nightmare recalled in the panicked breaths before it fades—for those below, the cloud-cities are no more than slurred shadows against a brilliant spillway of stars.</p>
<p>This is the age of humanity, when we discover magic and learn to dream again.</p>
